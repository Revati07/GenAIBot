What is wine? Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes or other fruits.
How is wine made? Wine is made by crushing grapes and fermenting the juice. The fermentation process converts the sugars in the grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide.
What are the types of wine? The main types of wine are red, white, and rosé. There are also sparkling wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines.
What is the best way to store wine? Wine should be stored in a cool, dark place with a consistent temperature, ideally between 50-59 degrees Fahrenheit (10-15 degrees Celsius). The bottles should be stored on their sides to keep the cork moist.
How long does wine last after opening? After opening, wine can last from 1 to 7 days depending on the type of wine and how it is stored. Red wines typically last 3-5 days, while white wines can last up to 7 days if refrigerated.
What is the difference between red and white wine? The primary difference between red and white wine is the grape skins. Red wine is made with dark-colored grape varieties and the skins are left on during fermentation, giving the wine its color and tannins. White wine is made from green or yellow grapes, and the skins are removed before fermentation.
What is the difference between rosé and red wine? Rosé wine is made from red grapes, but the grape skins are only in contact with the juice for a short time, giving it its pink color. Red wine, on the other hand, has longer skin contact during fermentation, resulting in its deeper color and fuller body.
What are some popular wine regions? Some popular wine regions include Bordeaux and Burgundy in France, Napa Valley in California, Tuscany in Italy, and Rioja in Spain.
How is sparkling wine different from still wine? Sparkling wine undergoes a second fermentation process that produces carbon dioxide, creating bubbles. This is typically done in large tanks or individual bottles, unlike still wine which only undergoes one fermentation.
What makes a wine "dry" or "sweet"? The sweetness of wine is determined by the amount of residual sugar left after fermentation. Dry wines have very little residual sugar, while sweet wines have higher levels of sugar remaining.
